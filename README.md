# cp-practice

This repository is dedicated to exploring and learning various features of **Golang** and **Python**, with a primary focus on solving **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems from **LeetCode**. The repository includes solutions in both languages, as I work through topics and concepts commonly encountered in coding interviews and competitive programming.

## Topics Covered

This repository contains solutions related to the following topics:

### Golang Features:
- **Concurrency (Go-routines, channels, select)**

### Python Features:

### DSA Features:
- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **2 Pointer Technique**
- **Sliding Window**
- **Hash Maps**
- **LinkedList**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Binary Trees (DFS, BFS)**
- **Binary Search Trees**
- **Graphs (DFS, BFS)**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Searching Algorithms**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**

## Getting Started

To get started with solving DSA problems in this repository, simply clone the repo:
