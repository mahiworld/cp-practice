# CP Practice

This repository is dedicated to practicing competitive programming (CP) questions in various programming languages. Currently, it contains two folders:

- **Golang**: For practicing competitive programming questions in Golang.
- **Python**: For practicing competitive programming questions in Python.

Additional folders will be added as I learn more languages and continue practicing competitive programming.
